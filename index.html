  <h1>RANDOM</h1>

  <h3>IN RANDOM WE TRUST</h3>
  <p>
    One random night with random people doing random tasks.<br/>
    Learn about yourself, open up and let the randomness in.

  <h3>EXPERIENCE LETTING GO</h3>
  <p>
    Imagine a world with a parallel social reality; a world in which every role and every action is determined by random, blind fate; where everything is given and nothing known; a world dominated by an all-consuming Lottery.<br/>
    Random is a performance with no performers and no director, run by a computer; it is a new species of social structure, where personal identity is constantly being rebuilt, and the meanings of authority, responsibility and free will are put to question.<br/>
    When one enters the site of the Random, she agrees to take upon herself, together with the other participants, the authority of a computer running a special software developed by the Random Committee.<br/>
    The computer constantly gives orders to all of the participants: orders that are randomly chosen in real time from a large database, encompassing all imaginable kinds of actions. Some are more long-lasting. Most of the orders are personal and discreet; some arenâ€™t. Thus the computer constantly regulates the actions, interactions and hierarchy in the ad hoc community. Due to its discreet nature, one cannot tell which part of the situation is the outcome of computer-given-orders, and which is not. The constant external intervention of the computer complicates the relations between deed and doer, and blurs the distinction between the private and the public spheres.<br/>
    One rule is solid: Random will never be documented. It is a social experiment meant to allow the participants to investigate themselves and their connection to others, art and life.
